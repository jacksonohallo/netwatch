# Description

I used the TMDB API for all of the data and  Firebase Authentication to give login functionality.Stored user specific data with a React front-end and a Firebase back-end. I used Firestore which is cloud storage with Firebase to save data. The front-end is styled with Tailwind CSS - an incredible CSS framework to save time styling .
